**Spare parts inventory assistant**

This is a basic C program made as an exercise for my programming course on DTU. It allows the user to ask for different electronic parts and says if they are in stock or not.

The 'Help' command lists all possible commands.

The 'List all parts' commands lists all of the parts in inventory and how many there are of them. It has dynamic formatting, so that parts with longer names can be added without ruining the spacing.

The 'Exit' command exits the program immediately.
